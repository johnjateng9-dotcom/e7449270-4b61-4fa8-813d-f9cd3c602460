# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Setting Up Your GitHub Repository

Follow these steps to push your CollabFlow project to GitHub:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository: `collabflow`
4. Add description: "Comprehensive collaboration platform with project management, real-time chat, analytics, and AI features"
5. Set to Public or Private (your choice)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Connect Your Replit Project to GitHub
From your Replit workspace terminal, run these commands:

```bash
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: CollabFlow full-stack application

- Complete backend infrastructure with PostgreSQL database
- JWT authentication system with bcrypt password hashing  
- REST API endpoints for all core features (teams, projects, tasks, channels, messages, documents)
- Frontend authentication integration with React hooks
- Dashboard components with real-time data fetching
- Glassmorphism design system with premium UI components
- Full-stack foundation ready for advanced features"

# Add GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/collabflow.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### 3. Repository Structure

Your repository will contain:

```
